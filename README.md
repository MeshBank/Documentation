MeshBank - The most powerful infrastructure for decentralized banking applications

Welcome to the MeshBank source code repository! MeshBank software enables developers to create and deploy high performance, horizontally scalable, blockchain infrastructure upon which decentralized banking applications can be built.

The code is currently pre-alpha and under rapid development. Early experimenters can run a private multi-node test network and develop, deploy, and test applications.
