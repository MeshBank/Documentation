# MeshBank Software Roadmap
This document outlines the development plan from a high level and will be updated as progress is made towards beta release. It should be noted that this roadmap applies only to the blockchain related software, after phase 4 is complete, a dedicated team will build on other tools and utilities such as wallets, and block explorers.

**Everything contained in this document is in draft form and subject to change at any time and provided for information purposes only. MeshBank does not gaurantee the accuracy of the information contained ni this roadmap and the information is provided "as is" with no representations or warranties, express or implied.**

## Phase 1 - Initiation
### Why this project?
MeshBank aims to create the most powerful infrastructure for decentralized banking applications. Publically auditable contracts create a self-regulating, decentralized network of interconnected nodes. The infrastructure provides a scaleable, reliable, decentralized network with unrivaled transaction speed and security.

### Is it feasible?
Yes. Utilizing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) we can run applications on the gigantic distributed computer. 

### Who are possible partners in the project?
Banking institutions, credit card processors, financial companies, ecommerce platforms

### What should the results be?
1. MeshBank is a decentralized autonomous organization that has real world employees that power the business. 
2. Nodes can vote on monthly budget allocations through community self governance.
3. Desktop application that allows users to send, receive, and invest in MeshBank's infrastructure (instant transactions, private "zk-snarks protocol", secure)
4. P2P Exchange built into desktop application
   - Support Zelle, Chase QuickPay, Cash Deposit, and US Postal Money Order

### What are the boundaries of this project?


## Phase 2 - Project Requirements
  
### Functional requirements
Digital currency
What the system is supposed to do, process orders, send bills, regulate the temperature etc. etc.

### Operational requirements
These are about how to run the system. Logging, startup/shutdown controls, monitoring, resource consumption, back up, availability etc.etc.

### Technical requirements
These are about how the system is built. Which language, which OS, standards to be adhered to etc.

### Design limitations
User interface

## Phase 3 - Design
Products:
Dioramas, sketches, flow charts, site trees, HTML screen designs, prototypes, all user interface etc.
