# MeshBank Software Roadmap
This document outlines the development plan from a high level and will be updated as progress is made towards beta release. It should be noted that this roadmap applies only to the blockchain related software, after phase 4 is complete, a dedicated team will build on other tools and utilities such as wallets, and block explorers.

## Phase 1 - Initiation
### Why this project?
MeshBank aims to create the most powerful infrastructure for decentralized banking applications. Publically auditable contracts create a self-regulating, decentralized network of interconnected nodes. The infrastructure provides a scaleable, reliable, decentralized network with unrivaled transaction speed and security.

### Is it feasible?
Yes. Utilizing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) we can run applications on the gigantic distributed computer. 

### Who are possible partners in the project?
Banking institutions, credit card processors, financial companies, ecommerce platforms

### What should the results be?
1. MeshBank's infrastructure creates a decentralized network of self regulating interconnected nodes
2. Mobile application that allows users to send, receive, and invest on MeshBank's infrastructure

### What are the boundaries of this project?


## Phase 2 - Project Requirements
  
### Functional requirements
What the system is supposed to do, process orders, send bills, regulate the temperature etc. etc.

### Operational requirements
These are about how to run the system. Logging, startup/shutdown controls, monitoring, resource consumption, back up, availability etc.etc.

### Technical requirements
These are about how the system is built. Which language, which OS, standards to be adhered to etc.

### Design limitations
User interface

## Phase 3 - Design
Products:
Dioramas, sketches, flow charts, site trees, HTML screen designs, prototypes, all user interface etc.

## Phase 4 - Development
- [ ] Genesis of MeshBank token
- [ ] Develop MeshBank's self regulating contracts
- [ ] Develop Meshbank's solidity


## Phase 5 - Implementation

## Phase 6 - Follow-up
